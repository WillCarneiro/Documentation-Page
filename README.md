# Building a Technical Documentation Page

Test with the purpose of checking what I have learned and obtaining the Responsive Web Design Certificate,

Where I was able to carry out the entire development of the HTML and CSS for the page alone.

###### The written content as well as the design is based on the reference template provided by the website itself: [Technical Documentation Page made by freeCodeCamp](https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks/)
